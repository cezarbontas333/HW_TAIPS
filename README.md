# HW_TAIPS
This is the source files for the project of TAIPS, a course at UPB CASTR programme.

## How to run:
In order to run the files, you need the data that was given at the course (this cannot be given as is) to be put under a different `./data/` directoty, and after that, convert all of the `.m` files to `.mat` files with the `runTS2DATA.m` routine. After that, run all of the simulator files `TAIPS_01x.m` in order and observe the results.

## Disclaimers
All files are subject to GPL unless author is denoted otherwise, at which sources should not be used as is.
